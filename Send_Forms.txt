Para validar formulários no estilo MVR( MODELS - VIEWS - ROUTES) Criamos 4 pastas ( geralmente eu as coloco na pasta SRC):
For validate forms in MVR, create four past :

*Controllers
*Models
*Views
*Routes
The documents was save in screen, inside her i put another doc call HOME.

1º) First, we create a routes
2º) After, we create action's in Controllers

  In action login we add a simple rule for the validate if exists values in the " name area" or another area.
if the camps pass in validate, this datas will save in req.session.user
